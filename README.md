Welcome to my profile! I'm jasmine-glancy. I'm interested in the various trends that can be found in data and how those trends impact us. 
In addition, I'm passionate about the welfare of humans and animals. I'd love to find ways to improve education and make life easier for us all! 


I'm currently taking the following courses to further my education:
- [100 days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) on Udemy (94% complete)
- [Mastering Linux: The Comprehensive Guide by Jannis Seemann](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-linux/) on Udemy (81% complete)
- [MongoDB Database Admin Path (self-managed)](https://learn.mongodb.com/learn/learning-path/mongodb-database-admin-self-managed-path) on MongoDB University (62% complete)
- [PL-300 certification prep: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst](https://www.udemy.com/course/70-778-analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-power-bi/) on Udemy (10% complete)

I have completed the following courses:
- [MongoDB Python Developer Path](https://learn.mongodb.com/learn/learning-path/mongodb-python-developer-path) on MongoDB University
- [CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) through Harvard University Open Source
- [The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero by Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/) on Udemy
- Data Analytics 101, Python 101: Introduction through [Girl Develop It](https://girldevelopit.com/)

I'm open to working on open source projects, especially those with environmental, veterinary, and/or medical impacts. Currently looking for groups!

You can reach me at jasmine.glancy.vt@gmail.com.

I have no strong preference for pronouns, but she/her works. 

Fun fact: I have a dog-shaped shadow named Jewel and a cat-shaped shadow named Artemis.
